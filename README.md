# Overview
<p>
    The objective of this game is to correctly guess the scrambled word. You will be provided with a scrambled word, and 
    you must unscramble the word and input it into the text box. If you are unable to unscramble the word, then you may get a 
    hint by pressing the "Get Hint" button, however, once you reach the last 3 letters, you will not be able to get any more
    hints. For each word correctly guessed, you get one point added to the score. If you are really stuck, there is a skip word button as well, however, this button will increment your incorrect guesses, so use wisely. There is also some features that will allow you to "Stimulate Your Mind", "Lock In", and "Relax Your Mind" (make sure you have your volume turned up).

# How to Run
<p>
    To run this program first you must download the ZIP file or clone the repository. After that, in your terminal, navigate to whichever 
    path the folder was sent to and type in the following commands: "cd frontend", "npm i vite", "npm run dev". After doing this, open a new terminal window and navigate to the file path of the folder once again. Once you have done this, type in the following commands: "cd backend" "npm i axios", "node index.js". If both commands run correctly, you should be able to open up a browser and type in the URL "localhost:5173" and it should appear. If it is not running correctly, make sure you have installed the dependencies required (you can view dependencies in package.json). Furthermore, if you want to see the unscrambled word, you can check the browser console, but technically that is cheating.

# Reflection
<p>
    Before this project, I had never worked in React, so completing this project helped me learn a lot about how React works and its pros and cons. I definetely will start using React for future projects over Bootstrap which is what I was using before. The project at first seemed somewhat challenging in theory because I was overthinking how to go about this, but once I went to the office hours, I realized that it was much simpler than I had imagined, however, I had my fair share of impediments.
